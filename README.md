# Bootstrap-4-Project

### `Description`

I love music, so I created a responsive DJ inspired theme with links going to separate html files. Main reason was to show my solid understanding of the Bootstrap 4 framework with Flexbox.

(Bootstrap 4 Grid System + Flexbox + Utilities + Components + Proper Documentation)
